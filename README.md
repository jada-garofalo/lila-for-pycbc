# lila-for-pycbc
Welcome! This is an active repo containing the progress for "lila" [ name is also a work in progress :p ], an addition to PyCBC's Detector class that will aim to handle detector-frame simulations for the proposed LILA detector, and will be written with modularity to support other next-generation detectors. Updates to come soon!

Please see lila.py for a snapshot into the latest functions I've written for the project [and please ignore my little incomplete sanity checks at the bottom lol].
