# lila-for-pycbc
Welcome! This is an active repo containing the progress for luna_push, an addition to PyCBC's Detector class that will aim to handle detector-frame simulations for the proposed LILA detector, and will be written with modularity to support other space-based next-generation detectors. Updates to come soon!

Please see luna_push.py for a snapshot into the latest functions I've written for the project.
